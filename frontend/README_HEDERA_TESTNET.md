## How Identity Creation Works

## What Happens When You Create Identity

1. **Wallet Prompt**: MetaMask will ask to switch to Hedera Testnet
2. **Gas Fee**: Uses test HBAR (completely free)

## Troubleshooting

### If MetaMask doesn't switch networks:
1. Manually add Hedera Testnet to MetaMask
2. Use the network details above
3. Or try refreshing the page

### If you don't have test HBAR:
1. Visit the Hedera portal faucet
2. Create a testnet account
3. Get free test HBAR tokens

### If the transaction fails:
1. Check you have test HBAR in your wallet
2. Make sure you're on Hedera Testnet
3. Try again - testnet can sometimes be slow
